# Decisions & drift log

A running log of every place the implementation diverged from the original plan, what we found, and what we decided instead. New entries go at the **top**.

Format: **Each entry has a status, context (what was planned), what we found, the new decision, and where the change landed.**

Status legend:
- 🟢 **Accepted** — change is live, original plan superseded.
- 🟡 **Superseded** — this decision was itself replaced by a later one.
- 🔵 **Revisit** — provisional, expected to change again in a later phase.

The numbered list is purely for cross-referencing — order is chronological by commit.

## D-009 — Promo classifier: per-retailer structural parsers + 7-type content classifier
🟢 Accepted · commit `1050a17`

**Originally planned ([DATA.md §4 first draft]):** one generic regex pass over the promo file, classifying via event-name keywords (`"multi"`, `"price drop"`, `"feature"`, etc.). Output: `{promo_type ∈ multi-pack | price-cut | feature | display | off-invoice | other}`.

**Found at implementation time:** that approach was wrong on two levels.
1. The column-header strings ("Mothers Day", "World Cup", "Christmas") are *retailer promotional-calendar events* (when each chain runs themed promos) — they're not Damm promo types. Matching against them yielded 92% `"other"`.
2. The actual promo *type* is encoded in the **cell content** of each `(SKU × week)` cell:
   - bare number `13.5` → regular shelf price
   - `"2 for £23"`, `"MTB 4f£7.50"` → multi-buy
   - `"RB £12/2 for £20"` → rollback (Asda format)
   - `"£11.00 WIGIG"` → clearance ("When-It's-Gone-It's-Gone")
   - `"LAUNCH"` / `"SKU replacement"` → listing change
   - empty cell → SKU not stocked that week

**Decision:**
- **5 bespoke per-retailer parsers** (one per sheet) because each sheet has a different grid structure (Tesco/Sainsbury's/Waitrose share a layout; Morrisons is pivoted; Asda uses R-codes with `dd/mm-dd/mm` headers).
- **7-type taxonomy** grounded in observed cell content: `regular | multi-buy | price-cut | rollback | clearance | listing | no-listing`. Mutually exclusive; one of them always applies.
- **Baseline-price-aware price-cut detection**: `price_gbp < median(regular cells per SKU) × 0.9` is promoted from `regular` to `price-cut`. No fixed thresholds across SKUs.
- **Assertion in `validate_promos()`**: ETL fails loudly if any cell escapes the 7-type set. No silent `"other"` bucket.

**Where it landed:** `backend/app/services/etl.py` `_PARSERS` dict + `_classify_cell()` + `parse_promos_all()`. [DATA.md §4](DATA.md) rewritten.

## D-008 — "Budget rows" aren't a budget at all; derive a target from prior-year actuals
🟢 Accepted · commit `1050a17`

**Originally planned ([DATA.md §3 first draft]):** the brief says "monthly budget or target estimate" is provided. The first ETL pass treated the 5,487 null-`Hl` rows in DATABASE as the budget plan and wrote them to `budgets.parquet`, with a TODO to identify which numeric column carries the budget volume.

**Found at implementation time:** auditing every column of the null-`Hl` rows showed:
- Distributed across **all four years** 2023-2026 (1,830 in 2023, 548 in 2024, 2,472 in 2025, 637 in 2026) — not future-only as a plan would be.
- `Mktg Fund` and `Otros Imp.` 100% null on them.
- `Venta Neta` mostly *negative*, small magnitudes (-£0.91, -£0.67, ...).
- `Margen Bruto` is 0% null but again mostly negative.

These rows are **accounting adjustments** (returns, credit notes, fee allocations posted without volume) — not a budget plan. There is no explicit budget column in `UK DATA.xlsx`.

**Decision:**
- Drop the null-`Hl` rows entirely in ETL.
- **Derive** a target series per `(material_id, sub_channel, date)`:
  ```
  target_hl = coalesce(
      prior_year_actual_hl,                # same SKU/channel 12 months earlier
      trailing_3_month_median(actual_hl),  # cold-start fallback
  )
  ```
- Surface a `target_source ∈ {"prior_year", "trailing_median"}` column so the FE can show confidence per cell.
- 4,244 monthly rows → 1,101 prior-year + 3,143 trailing-median fallback.

**Where it landed:** `backend/app/services/etl.py` `filter_actuals()` and `derive_targets()`. Outputs `snapshots/targets.parquet` (replaces the misleading `budgets.parquet`). [DATA.md §3b](DATA.md) is a new section explaining this.

**Future revisit:** if Damm provides an actual budget file later, swap the derivation for the real plan and keep `target_source = "official"` as a third value.

## D-007 — Hero SKU is picked dynamically from data, not hardcoded
🟢 Accepted · commit `8de871a`

**Originally planned ([DEMO.md, DATA.md §7]):** hero was `K015600 × GROCERY` as a placeholder.

**Found at implementation time:** `K015600` doesn't appear in the GROCERY subchannel after the join. The real top-volume Estrella×Grocery SKU is `EX23SRAN` (103,998 Hl over 37 months).

**Decision:** `write_meta()` in `etl.py` picks the hero dynamically — top-volume SKU within `(top_brand × GROCERY)` — so it stays accurate as data evolves. `/api/meta` reads it from `meta.json`.

**Where it landed:** `backend/app/services/etl.py` `write_meta()` and `backend/app/routers/meta.py`. The hard-coded placeholder is gone.

## D-006 — Frontend snapshot mode (`⌘+.`) removed
🟢 Accepted · commit `b8c16b4`

**Originally planned ([FRONTEND.md, AGENT.md early draft, DEMO.md]):** a `⌘+.` keyboard shortcut would toggle the API client base URL from `http://localhost:8000` to `/snapshots/*.json` static files served by Vite. A "demo safety net" so a venue Wi-Fi failure couldn't break the live demo.

**User preference (mid-build):** "always run the backend, not precomputed/fake labeled data."

**Decision:** removed the FE-side static fallback entirely. The frontend always calls the live backend; if the backend is unreachable, that's a real error surfaced via a Sonner toast.

Note the distinction (often confused):
- ❌ **FE snapshot mode** (now removed) — static JSON bypassing the API.
- ✅ **Backend parquet caches** in `snapshots/*.parquet` (kept) — these are the *trained model's output*, not fake data. The backend reads them because retraining LightGBM on every API hit is pointless. This is normal storage architecture.

**Safety net for the demo** is now just: a pre-recorded **backup video** (gitignored, recorded morning of demo).

**Where it landed:** removed code in `App.tsx`, `api.ts`. Removed sections from `FRONTEND.md`, `AGENT.md` (replaced with "ML output caching" section), `DEMO.md`, `PLAN.md`, `README.md`.

## D-005 — `.env.example` trimmed to what code actually reads
🟢 Accepted · commit `b8c16b4`

**Originally planned:** `.env.example` carried 12 variables for "future-proofing" (HF_ORG, LLM_*_MODEL/PROVIDER overrides, FRED_API_KEY, SNAPSHOT_MODE, RELOAD, PYTHONHASHSEED, etc.).

**Found at implementation time:** none of those were actually read by any code; they were aspirational. Easy way to confuse a teammate.

**Decision:** `.env.example` now has only:
- `HF_TOKEN` (required; can also come from `hf auth login` cache)
- `MONGO_URI`, `MONGO_DB` (optional, Phase 5+)
- `LOG_LEVEL`

Defaults for model + provider live in `backend/app/services/llm.py`. `PYTHONHASHSEED=42` is set inline by the Makefile only when running our Python scripts.

**Where it landed:** `.env.example`, `Makefile`. Also `llm.py` resolves the HF token from env first, then `~/.cache/huggingface/token`.

---

## D-004 — Makefile `PYTHONHASHSEED` scoped to PY commands only
🟢 Accepted · commit `b8c16b4`

**Originally planned:** `export PYTHONHASHSEED := 42` at the top of the Makefile, applying to every subprocess for deterministic anonymization.

**Found:** that broke `hf` CLI because its bundled Python rejected the env var at config_init time (`Fatal Python error: config_init_hash_seed`). `make doctor` failed with "token invalid" even though the token was fine.

**Decision:** scope it to a `PY` variable used only by our scripts: `PY := PYTHONHASHSEED=42 uv run python`. Other tools (`hf`, `pnpm`, etc.) get a clean environment.

**Where it landed:** `Makefile`.

## D-003 — LLM routing: two profiles (Llama-Groq fast + Kimi-K2-Instruct deep), not one Kimi-K2.6
🟢 Accepted · commit `7520ecc`

**Originally planned ([STACK.md, AGENT.md early draft]):** primary LLM = `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6` via Novita (1.1T params, latest in the K2 family). Fallback = Llama-3.3-70B via Groq.

**Live-benchmarked from the EHubBarcelona org token** before locking it in. Kimi K2.6 is a **thinking model**: it spends all its tokens on `reasoning_content` and never produces a final answer in usable latency. A 400-token cap call finished after 16 seconds with **0 chars** of `content` and `finish_reason: length`.

**Decision:** two-profile routing keyed by purpose, not one model.
| Profile | Model | Provider | Latency | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fast` | `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` | Groq | **0.86s** | chat, tool-call loops, explain-view (everything latency-sensitive) |
| `deep` | `moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct` | Novita | 5.0s | `/api/recommend` only — the 3-scenario money endpoint |
| `fallback` | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct` | auto | 2.4s | any 5xx/429 |

Kimi K2-Instruct (non-thinking) produces specific CPG-vocabulary outputs ("off-invoice promotion", "in-aisle barkers", "incremental display") that Llama doesn't — worth the 4s on the recommendation page. Kimi K2.6 is dropped entirely; saved for offline tasks.

**Where it landed:** `backend/app/services/llm.py` (`MODELS` dict + `call_with_fallback()`). [AGENT.md](AGENT.md) §Models rewritten with the benchmark table.

## D-002 — TypeScript `verbatimModuleSyntax` disabled
🟢 Accepted · commit `a4fc2bf`

**Originally planned:** keep Vite's default `verbatimModuleSyntax: true` (strictest TS posture).

**Found:** Magic UI components installed via the shadcn registry don't use `import type` for type-only imports, so the build fails on every install:
```
error TS1484: 'MotionStyle' must be imported using a type-only import…
```

**Decision:** set `verbatimModuleSyntax: false` in `tsconfig.app.json`. Cleaner than patching every Magic UI component after install. Type-safety is preserved by the rest of the strict settings; this only affects how runtime imports are emitted.

**Where it landed:** `frontend/tsconfig.app.json`.

## D-001 — Frontend `src/lib/` was being gitignored
🟢 Accepted · commit `a4fc2bf`

**Originally planned:** `frontend/src/lib/` holds `api.ts`, `api.gen.ts`, `utils.ts` — the typed API client and shadcn's `cn()` helper.

**Found:** the root `.gitignore` had `lib/` and `lib64/` from a generic Python template, which silently ate `frontend/src/lib/` too. `git status` showed `api.gen.ts` as untracked but `git add` printed "ignored by .gitignore".

**Decision:** remove the generic `lib/`/`lib64/`/`dist/`/`downloads/` patterns from the Python section (uv doesn't make them anyway) and add an explicit `!frontend/src/lib/` re-include.

**Where it landed:** `.gitignore`.

## How to add a new entry

When you implement something differently from the plan:

1. **Update the source-of-truth doc** ([PLAN.md](PLAN.md), [DATA.md](DATA.md), [ML.md](ML.md), [AGENT.md](AGENT.md), [STACK.md](STACK.md), [PAGES.md](PAGES.md), [FRONTEND.md](FRONTEND.md), [DEMO.md](DEMO.md) — whichever applies) so it stays current with reality. Don't leave the original wrong text in place.
2. **Add an entry here** at the top with: status, context (what was planned), what you found, the decision, where it landed.
3. **Link to the relevant commit** in the entry header so readers can `git show <hash>` for the full change.

If a previous entry gets superseded by a new one, change its status from 🟢 to 🟡 and add a "→ superseded by D-NNN" note. Don't delete history.
